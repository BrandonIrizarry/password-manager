* Introduction

Password Manager is an Elisp library for managing usernames and
passwords. The idea is that the user sets up an Org document, where
headlines (for now, all level 1):

1. bear text representing a given service;
2. possess username, password, and other relevant fields as
   properties;
3. can contain elaborative text in their bodies.

(Note: I don't vouch for any of the example [fake] passwords shown
here being necessarily secure. ðŸ˜€)

#+begin_example
* Hometown Electric Company
:PROPERTIES:
:username: Jane Doe
:password: gazillionth_3Vug+E?~i.["tY7ApDU1)
:END:

This is my username and password information for my light bill.

* FindOut Credit Card
:PROPERTIES:
:username: FullName
:password: the_lazy_fox_jumped_over_the_MOON_12345
:pin: 1111
:END:

My credit card information.
#+end_example

* A Note on Encryption
Ideally, one would take the further step of encrypting this Org
document. This application doesn't handle encryption; it only makes
searching for and setting data easier, as it's built on top of
existing Org Mode facilities.

* Usage
There is only one user-facing function: 'password-manager-do-action'.

This is currently not bound to any key.

While in their Org document containing their credentials, the user can
run this command, at which point they're prompted to select one of
"Set username", "Set password", or "Copy property to clipboard". Then,
the user is prompted to select from among the headlines in their
document. Then, the logic proceeds according to the action selected.

** Password Generation
In particular, when setting a password, the user is offered a choice
between setting a custom password, which the user must fill out. If
the user leaves the corresponding field blank, a random, secure
password is generated and supplied as the user's choice for the new
password.

** Overriding Existing Username and Password Fields
If a username or password is to be set for a particular headline, a
warning about overriding that property is issued. In this sense, the
properties =:username= and =:password:= have special status, which is
of course the goal of this application.
